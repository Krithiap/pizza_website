    <h2>Movie Review</h2>
    
    <p>My husband and I watched the movie “You’ve Got Mail” recently. We rented this title from Amazon Prime Video and watched it during our recent stay at Prescott when it was snowing quite heavily outside. It was a perfect movie for a snow day! The movie is set in the mid 90’s when laptops were heavy and big and you had to connect to the internet via a dial up modem. My husband instantly recognized the dial tone and said it was quite nostalgic to hear it again and reminded him of the good old days of the 90’s.</p>
       
    <p>The movie is about how superstore magnate Joe Fox and a small business independent book store owner Kathleen Kelly fall for each other in the anonymity of the internet. The movie was released in late 90’s and my first impressions were that the computers and internet seemed to be recent phenomenon based on the hardware and software technology used for the movie. The mail and chat user interfaces were very simple yet functional. I noticed that at one point in the movie, Tom Hanks (who played the character Joe Fox) had to hit the backspace key repeatedly to delete a bunch of lines as it seems the select all & delete feature was yet to be developed! The movie was very realistic and it aptly portrayed that the person in real life and the person behind the keyboard could be very different and it is quite difficult to judge a character just based on the posts over the internet. This seems to be applicable even in present times as the character which comes out in social media may not always be the same as in real life.</p>
       
    <p>I liked how the anonymous conversations between the Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly were very decent, how they stuck to the boundaries set by them and the level of trust they had in each other. This would not be possible in present times as it could be very dangerous to have such anonymous conversations over the internet. Overall, my husband and I quite enjoyed the movie and hope to see many such simple and stress free movies set in the 90’s.</p>
