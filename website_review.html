    WEBSITE REVIEW
    </h1>
    
    
    <h2>GOOD WEBSITE</h2>
    
    <p>
        In my opinion, an example of a good website to get the latest news and current affairs would be www.npr.org. I find this website having a simple and clean layout and the different news articles neatly organized. I also find that I can rely on the news presented from this source with confidence and that the news articles are well researched and written. Though the website does have advertisements, I am able to clearly make out which sections are advertisements and which sections have news content. I also find the font and font size to be plesant for reading.

    <h2>BAD WEBSITE</h2>
    
    <p> In my opinion, an example of a bad website would be www.yahoo.com. The website has too many advertisements disguised as regular news articles and it is hard to make out which content is legitimate news article and which links are pure advertisement or paid content. I also feel the website feels a little bit overwhemling and quite disorganized. A website which provides news for public consumption should ensure users do not confuse paid content with legitimate news content. Otherwise, it may influence the reader with false content which may influence the user one way or the other. I also find the font and size to cause too much content to be crammed in a too little space. </p>
