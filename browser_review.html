<h2> What's the best web browser overall, my impressions</h2>

Home page: Most of us are familiar with the home page of Google Chrome and Firefox, both of them are simple and much similar to each other. Personally, I feel the tab bar of Google Chrome is more easier to use than Firefox. We can also access other Google services like Gmail from the browser. Microsoft launched the redesigned Edge browser in early 2020 based on Google Chromium code. The new Microsoft edge has the same tab page of the original browser but it was tweaked to be a litter better, and you can customize it as the way you like by adding a Google page to be the start page.

Extensions and Apps: Extensions allows users to install add-ons that bring more features. We can add extensions from the Chrome web store in the Chrome browser, and get add-ons from the addons.mozilla.org in the Firefox browser, therefore in terms of the extension diversity, Google Chrome is better than the Firefox. While Microsoft Edge chromium enables users to add extensions from Microsoft Store, Google page and Google Store, which makes it the best one among the three web browsers.

Setting Menu: When it comes to setting menu, the three web browsers are very similar. The setting menu is on the right upper corner. But their focus is a litter different. Firefox puts the security and privacy in the fore front, while the chromium edge and Google Chrome seem to pay more attention to user experience. However, the three nearly offers the same options for users.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <p>Google Chrome and Firefox are the mature browsers in the market, both of them support Windows, Linux, macOS and iOS. The new Microsoft edge can be installed by default on Windows devices but also available for macOS, iOS and very recently on Linux. As we can see from above comparison metrics, it is not an easy decision to recommend a browser as each browser excels in certain benchmarks and lags in others. However, considering above comparison results, I would recommend Chrome as the browser of choice since it offers a good balance between speed, security and compatibility. </p>
